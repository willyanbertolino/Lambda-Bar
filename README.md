# Lambda-Bar
Simple web Project

Deployed on Netlify: https://lambda-bar-willyan-bertolino.netlify.app

This project was inspired in John Smilga's project, from his Udemy HTML and CSS Tutorial and Projects course.
I changed some things in the style and HTML files, added a carousel in the home page, but removed it in the products page, also changed the scroll bars styles.
All images used are free (https://www.pexels.com).
The site is responsive (there is better solutions for it, but just to practice) and use a little bit of Javascript to control the navigation sidebar and to get the current date (as the instructor JS file).
The form uses Formspree as backend alternative.
