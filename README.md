# Lambda-Bar
Simple web Project

Deployed on Netlify: https://lambda-bar-willyan-bertolino.netlify.app

This project was inspired in John Smilga's project, from his Udemy HTML and CSS Tutorial and Projects course.
I changed some things in the style and HTML files, added a carousel in the home page, but removed it in the products page, also changed the scroll bars styles.
All images used are free (gotten from Pexel's website).
The site is responsive (there is better solutions for it, but just to practice) and use a bit of Javascript to control the navigation sidebar and to get the current date (as the instructor JS file).
The form uses Formspree as backend alternative.
